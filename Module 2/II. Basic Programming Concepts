# Module 2: Introduction to Programming for IoT

## 2.1 Basic Programming Concepts

### 2.1.1 Check Your Understanding - Follow the Flowchart
- **Door status**
  - The sensor is checking for a **closed door.**
- **Status check frequency**
  - The sensor is checked **every 2 seconds.**
- **Alarm - open 5 sec**
  - The alarm will sound if the door is open for **5 seconds.**
- **Alarm - open 10 sec**
  - The alarm will sound if the door is open for **10 seconds.**
- **Alarm - open/shut**
  - The alarm will **not** sound if the door is open for 5 seconds, shut for 5 seconds, then reopened for 5 seconds.

### 2.1.2 Flowcharts
- Flowcharts are visual representations used in engineering, physical sciences, and computer programming.
- They illustrate processes or workflows, focusing on logic rather than specific programming syntax.
- Flowcharts show input states, decisions, and results, making them easy to understand.

### 2.1.3 System Software, Application Software, and Computer Languages
- **Software Types:**
  - **System Software:** Controls computer hardware (e.g., Linux, Apple OSX, Microsoft Windows).
  - **Application Software:** Designed for specific tasks (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer).
- **Programming Languages:**
  - Used to create software.
  - Examples: C++ (compiled), Python (interpreted).

### 2.1.4 Programming Variables
- **Variables:**
  - Dynamic containers holding data or information.
  - Types: Local (within a scope), Global (program execution scope).
  - Facilitate code reuse with different data.

### 2.1.5 Basic Program Structures
- **Logic Structures:**
  - **IF-THEN:** Decision-making based on expressions.
  - **FOR Loops:** Execute instructions a specific number of times.
  - **WHILE Loops:** Execute instructions while an expression is true.
- **Example Python Code:**
  ```python
  # Program to Verify Leap Years in Python
  year = int(input("Enter a year to check if it is a leap year\n"))
  if (year % 4) == 0:
      if (year % 100) == 0:
          if (year % 400) == 0:
              print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
          else:
              print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
      else:
          print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
  else:
      print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
