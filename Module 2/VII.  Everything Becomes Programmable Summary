## 2.6.1 Everything Becomes Programmable Summary

### Basic Programming Concepts
- Flowcharts depict processes; two types of software: system and application software.
- Programming variables: Local (scoped within a program) and Global (accessible throughout program execution).
- Common logic structures: IF-THEN, FOR Loops, WHILE Loops.
- Blockly: Visual programming tool for beginners, utilizing colored blocks to represent programming structures.
- Python: Interpreted language, supports variables, functions, and various data types.

### Prototyping
- Prototyping is the process of creating a working model of a product or system.
- Google used the "Rapid Prototyping Method" for Google Glass.
- Internet platforms (Makezine, Makerbot, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone) facilitate collaboration.
- Prototyping materials range from wood and metal to plastic, clay, and 3D printing.

### Programming Resources
- MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy, and Code Academy offer free programming courses.
- Programming is critical for IoT development; Python is a popular language.
- Community workshops and online platforms like Kickstarter aid exposure for ideas and prototypes.
