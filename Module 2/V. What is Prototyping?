# 2.4 What is Prototyping?

## 2.4.1 Defining Prototyping

**Prototyping in IoT:**
- Prototyping in the Internet of Things (IoT) requires diverse skills:
  - Design skills
  - Electronics skills
  - Physical/mechanical skills
  - Networking and programming skills
  - Knowledge of cloud computing
  - Understanding of network and device security

**IoT Development Challenges:**
- The IoT is evolving, presenting unknown tasks.
- Opportunity for inventors due to the combination of people, process, data, and things in IoT.

**Characteristics of Prototyping:**
- Fully functional but not fault-proof.
- Actual, working version of the product.
- Used for performance evaluation and further improvement.
- Has a complete interior and exterior.
- May be relatively expensive to produce.
- Often used in the IoT as a technology demonstrator.

## 2.4.2 How to Prototype

**Prototyping Methods:**
- Google's "Rapid Prototyping Method" used for Google Glass.
- "Google Glass Rapid Prototype TED Talk" video showcases the approach.

**Financial Support:**
- Prototyping involves costs for materials and labor.
- Crowd funding platforms (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdfunder) provide financial support.
- Example: "Pebble Time Kickstarter Video" used to fund Pebble Time smartwatch.

**Encouragement for Inventors:**
- Encourages individuals to turn ideas into reality.
- Crowd funding enables a broader range of inventors to prototype their IoT concepts.

*Note:*
- Prototyping plays a crucial role in the development of IoT devices, allowing for testing, refinement, and demonstration of innovative ideas.
