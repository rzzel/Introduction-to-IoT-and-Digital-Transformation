2.3.5 Programming Structures in Python
Programming Structures:

IF-THEN Structures:

Decision-making based on expressions.
IF-THEN, ELSE, ELIF structures.
Example:

# IF-THEN, ELSE, ELIF block for decision-making
x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')

FOR Loop Structure:
Iterates over items in a sequence.
Example measuring string lengths.

# FOR Loop
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print(w, len(w))

WHILE Loop:
Executes a block of code while a condition is true.
Example calculating Fibonacci series.

# WHILE Loop
a, b = 0, 1
while b < 10:
    print(b)
    a, b = b, a + b

Note:

Proper indentation is crucial in Python for grouping statements.
Indentation defines blocks of code (IF-THEN, FOR, WHILE).
