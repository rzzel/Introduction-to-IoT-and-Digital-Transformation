**6.2.1 Communities of Interest**

A community of interest is a group of people who share a common interest or passion about a specific topic. These people get together to share information and ideas about this topic.

This shared interest allows the group to develop into a true community. Members of these communities are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the topic being discussed and are willing to share their knowledge with other community members. This makes the community an excellent resource for the development of the area of interest.

Several IoT communities exist, including those run by IEEE, LinkedIn, and technology-related organizations. The IoT World Today site and email list is an outlet for IoT-related news and developments. Cisco provides communities like the Cisco Learning Network and Cisco DevNet, supporting the development of skills in various Cisco technologies. Subscribing to an IoT news resource is recommended to stay updated on daily developments.

**6.2.2 Industry Certifications**

Industry certifications are highly respected by employers and help validate the skills needed for successful careers in networking and IT. There are vendor-specific and vendor-neutral certifications. Cisco offers relevant certifications for IoT:

- Networking: Cisco Certified Network Administrator (CCNA)
- Security: Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (CBROPS)
- Automation: Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (DEVASC)

Certifications must often be renewed over time, requiring continuing education units (CEUs) or re-certification exams.

**6.2.3 Additional Learning Opportunities**

Certifications demonstrate specific skills, while community college or university degrees provide a broad understanding. A combination of industry certifications and degrees is beneficial for pursuing IoT careers. Degrees in areas such as Computer Science, Computer Programming, Network Administration, and more are relevant. Traditional degrees in business, project management, supply chain management, and others are also valuable for IoT careers.
