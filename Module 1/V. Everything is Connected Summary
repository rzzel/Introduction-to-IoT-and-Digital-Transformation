## 1.5 Everything is Connected Summary

### 1.5.1 Everything is Connected Summary
- **Topics Covered:**
  1. Digitization Transforms Business
- The world is quickly being covered with networks which allow digital devices to interconnect and transmit. 
As digital networks continue to grow around the world, and as the economic benefits of digitization continue to grow, 
we are seeing a digital transformation. Digital transformation is the application of digital technology to provide the 
stage for business and industry to innovate.
Sensors are now everywhere, collecting and transmitting massive amounts of data. The generated data can be stored and analyzed at a later date, 
or it can be analyzed and used immediately. The analyzed data is used by governments, cities, businesses, and individuals to effect changes such as 
monitoring the environment, forecasting population growth, controlling waste management, or securing a home.

  2. Globally Connected Through Networks
- Networks form the foundation of the digitized world. There are many types of networks that are characterized by their geographic size, 
by the number of devices or networks that they connect, and by whether they support mobile devices or not. Networks can also be characterized by their 
function and purpose.
PAN: Bluetooth
LAN
WAN: Internet, the cloud, edge computing
Wireless: Wi-Fi, Cellular

  3. The Growth of IoT Devices
  4. Connecting IoT Devices to the Network
