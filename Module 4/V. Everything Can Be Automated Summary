4.4 Everything Can Be Automated Summary


Automation
This module began by discussing automation. Automation is any process that is self-driven and reduces, then eventually eliminates, the need for human intervention. The IoT opens up a new world in which tasks previously requiring human intervention can become automated. Many devices now incorporate smart technology to alter their behavior under certain circumstances. Some examples of smart technology can be found in smart homes and buildings, cities, a smart power grid, and smart cars.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
Next, the module detailed Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the intelligence demonstrated by machines. As technology develops, many of the tasks that at one time required AI have become routine. Many of these tasks have migrated from AI to Machine Learning (ML). ML is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to “learn” from their environment. Some examples of ML in the IoT include speech and facial recognition, product recommendation, and credit card fraud detection.

Intent-Based Networking
The next topic of this module covered Intent-Based Networking (IBN). The new business network must integrate IoT devices, cloud-based services, and remote offices in a way that is relevant and responsive to business. The network must secure these new digital initiatives from the ever-changing threat landscape. IBN is a systematic approach to tie infrastructure management to business intent.

An IBN uses AI and ML to ensure that any services that are deployed meet the required service level. A model of IBN contains three elements including assurance, translation, and activation. The Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA) is an example of an intent-based network. It is an open, extensible, software-driven architecture. It accelerates and simplifies enterprise network operations, while lowering costs and reducing risks.
