# 4.1 Automation



## 4.1.1 Video - What is Automation?

Automation is any process that is self-driven and reduces or eliminates the need for human intervention. It has evolved beyond the manufacturing industry, where repetitive tasks were turned over to machines. Automation, facilitated by the Internet of Things (IoT), allows the collection of vast amounts of data for quick analysis, providing valuable insights. This video explores examples of automation.

## 4.1.2 How is Automation Being Used?

### Smart Home Automation
- For many, the home environment has become a more automated environment. Devices such as the Apple Homekit, Amazon Alexa and Echo, and Google Assistant allow us to give voice commands to control such things as lights, locks, doors, thermostats, plugs, switches, alarm systems, window coverings, sprinkler system sensors, and more. Even kitchen appliances and pet care functions are being automated. Companies are producing new products every day to work with these home automation systems.

### Smart Buildings
- Enterprises of all types are using smart technology to automate building processes. Smart Buildings deploy many of the same technologies as smart homes. These processes provide efficient lighting, energy, heating, air conditioning, and security. For example, a smart building can reduce energy costs using sensors that detect how many occupants are in a room and adjust the heating or cooling appropriately.
Smart buildings can also connect to and communicate with the smart grid. This enables more efficient management of energy systems.

### Industrial IoT and Smart Factories

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates machines, analytics, and people, creating a network of manufacturing devices and sensors. Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, extends automation to various functions beyond manufacturing.

### Smart Cities
- What do Hamburg, Barcelona, Kansas City, Jaipur, Copenhagen, and Manchester have in common? They are all “smart cities” that use digital technology to make their city a better place to live. Some of these cities use technology to reduce carbon emissions or monitor CO2 levels. Others use technology to provide free city-wide Wi-Fi access, improve public safety, or improve transportation options.
