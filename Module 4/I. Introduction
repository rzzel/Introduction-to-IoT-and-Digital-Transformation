# 4.0 Introduction

## 4.0.1 Iota - Why Should I Take this Module?

The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes truly fascinating when you combine connectivity, programming knowledge, sensors, actuators, and data. This combination enables automation of various tasks. For example, connecting your smartphone to a smart oven allows you to instruct it to bake something at a specific time, providing a convenient way to have warm cake ready when you return home.

Automation goes beyond simple device connections. Industries like automobile manufacturing showcase advanced automation, where robots assemble cars, monitored by humans to ensure efficiency. Rideshare apps leverage machine learning from traffic IoT devices for optimal routing, saving time and money. The IoT opens doors to automate numerous processes, prompting the question: What would you automate?
