# 3.2 Where is Big Data Stored?

## 3.2.1 What Are the Challenges of Big Data?

- The rapid growth of data:
  - Advantage or obstacle for achieving business goals.
  - Traditional technologies and data warehouses struggle with storage needs.
  - Security concerns with cloud storage.
  
## 3.2.2 Where Can We Store Big Data?

### Edge Computing

- Architecture utilizing end-user clients or devices for pre-processing and storage.
- Keeps data closer to the source, reducing bandwidth requirements.
- Enables quicker communication between devices and servers.
- After pre-processing, data is often sent for longer-term storage, backup, or deeper analysis within the cloud.

### Cloud and Cloud Computing

- Collection of data centers providing software, storage, and services via the internet.
- Services offered by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
- Allows individuals to store data, access applications, and access data from anywhere.
- Enterprise benefits include streamlined IT operations, reduced onsite equipment, and cost savings.

## 3.2.4 Distributed Processing

- Analytics becomes challenging with the exponential growth of data.
- Distributed data processing breaks large data into smaller pieces for analysis.
- Each computer in the distributed architecture processes its part (horizontal scaling).
- Hadoop, an open-source software, is designed for distributed processing of large data sets.
- Hadoop features scalability and fault tolerance.
